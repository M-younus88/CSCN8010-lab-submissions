    "The model with the highest R-Squared value indicates the highest proportion of variance in the target variable (diabetes) that is explained by the model. A higher R-Squared value suggests that the model fits the data well and can better predict the target variable. Therefore, choosing the model with the highest R-Squared indicates a stronger relationship between the predictors (polynomial features) and the target variable.\n",

MAE represents the average absolute difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the target variable. A lower MAE indicates that the model's predictions are closer to the actual values on average. Therefore, choosing the model with the lowest MAE indicates better accuracy and precision in predicting the target variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, by selecting the model with the highest R-Squared value, we prioritize the model's ability to explain the variance in the target variable. On the other hand, by choosing the model with the lowest MAE value, we emphasize the model's accuracy in predicting the target variable. Both criteria provide valuable insights into the model's performance and can guide the decision-making process."
